# Student Feedback on Teaching (SFT)

Feedback is *optional* but *highly encouraged*, access here: **[https://es.nus.edu.sg/blue/](https://es.nus.edu.sg/blue/)**

* **[Tutorial Feedback]** Your feedback is important to me, and will be used to improve my teaching.
  * If I have helped your learning in any way, your positive feedback will be an encouragement to me.
  * If you find your learning can be enhanced by some action on my part, that feedback will be used to improve my teaching.
* **[Module Feedback]** Your feedback will be used to improve the module.
* Feedback is confidential to the university and anonymous to us.
* Avoid mixing the feedback; ie. project feedback to tutorial feedback.

Past student feedback had been used to improve teaching; ie. Telegram access to provide faster feedback.
I would greatly appreciate your feedback, especially this is my first time teacing AI.

# Recap tutorial

* Tutorial will be rescheduled due to college well-being day; 
  * I will consolidate the 3 tutorials into 1 or 2.
  * Select all that you are avaliable: **Apr 13, 3-4pm or 4-5pm or 5-6pm.**
* Prof Daren will upload a review tutorial: No assignment questions & $4$ past yr qns.
* I have decided to help all of you with a special recap; two options
  1. Recap one topic + Quickly go through the $4$ past year questions
  1. Go through 4 past year questions + Time for Q&A at the end

# Previously from T08, Q1

Consider below, a Vertex Cover where it is a set of vertices that covers all edges.

::: columns

:::: {.column width=50%}

i. Write down the constraints as logical statements for a vertex cover of size 1.
i. Apply the resolution algorithm in order to prove that the vertex 1 must be part of the vertex cover.

## Recap

* What is a Vertex Cover of size $k$?
* How to formulate a $KB$ problem?

## Answer T8.Q1.i - Formulating KB

**Variables**: 

* $x_i$ represents $i$ node on the graph that is in the vertex cover.
* $\neg x_i$ represents not in the vertex cover.

**Constraints**: 

* Edge cover constraints: $x_1 \vee x_2$; $x_1 \vee x_3$; $x_1 \vee x_4$
* Size $k = 1$ constraints: (We ignore contrapositive)
  * $x_1$ set then... $x_1\implies\neg x_2$; $x_1\implies\neg x_3$; $x_1\implies\neg x_4$
  * $x_2$ set then... $x_2\implies\neg x_3$; $x_2\implies\neg x_4$;
  * $x_3$ set then... $x_3\implies\neg x_4$

Then convert to CNF!

## Answer T8.Q1.ii

Show $KB\models \alpha = x_1$; we resolve $KB\wedge \neg x_1$

1. $\neg x_1 \oplus x_1 \vee x_2 \implies x_2$
1. $x_2 \oplus \neg x_2 \vee \neg x_3 \implies \neg x_3$
1. $\neg x_1 \oplus x_1 \vee x_3 \implies x_3$
1. $x_3 \oplus \neg x_3 \implies \square$

# Question 1

Having both good grades (G) and good communication skills (C) will increase your chances of performing well in your interview (I).

::: columns

## Recap

* How to read a Bayes Network?
* What is Marginalisation?

 ---

## Answer

What is the probability that

a. Alice, who has poor grades and communication skills, performs well on her interview? - $Pr[I = 1|G = 0, C = 0] = 0.1$
b. Bob is a student with great communication skills, assuming we do not know anything about him? - $Pr[C = 1] = 0.2$
c. A student has good communication skills, given that he or she has performed well in an interview? - $Pr[C = 1|I = 1]=\frac{Pr[C = 1, I = 1]}{Pr[I = 1]}=\frac{\sum_g Pr[G=g, C = 1, I = 1]}{\sum_{g,c} Pr[G=g, C = c,I = 1]} = 0.339$
    a. Are good communication skills independent of good performance in an interview? - Remember independence; $Pr[C = 1|I = 1] \neq Pr[C = 1]$.

# Question 2

Assume that 2\% of the population in a country carry a particular virus ($Y$ is a carrier). 
A test kit developed to detect the presence ($X$ is positive test).

$Y$|$Pr[X=1|Y]$
:-:|:-:
1|0.998
0|$1-0.996=0.004$

## Recap

* What is Conditional Probability?
* What is Conditional Independence?

 . . . 

Careful with the conditional independence here...

--- 

## Answer 2a

Given that a patient is tested to be positive using this kit, what is the posterior belief that he is not a carrier?

$Pr[Y=0|X=1] = \frac{Pr[Y=0, X=1]}{Pr[X=1]} = \frac{Pr[Y=0, X=1]}{\sum_y Pr[Y=y,X=1]} = \frac{Pr[X=1|Y=0]\times Pr[Y=0]}{\sum_y Pr[Y=y,X=1]} = 0.164$

## Answer 2b

Patient tested positive again using the second kit ($X_2$ is the second test, $X_1$ is the first test).
Assume conditional independence between results of different test kits given the patientâ€™s state of virus contraction.

$Pr[Y=0|X_1=1, X_2=1] = 0.0008$ 

* $= \frac{Pr[Y=0, X_2=1,X_1=1]}{Pr[X_1=1, X_2=1]}= \frac{Pr[X_2=1,X_1=1|Y=0]Pr[Y=0]}{Pr[X_1=1, X_2=1]}$ (Conditional Probability)
* $= \frac{Pr[X_2=1|Y=0]Pr[X_1=1|Y=0]Pr[Y=0]}{Pr[X_1=1, X_2=1]}$ (Conditional Independence)
* $= \frac{Pr[X_2=1|Y=0]Pr[X_1=1|Y=0]Pr[Y=0]}{\sum_y Pr[X_1=1, X_2=1, Y=y]}$ (Marginalisation)
* $= \frac{Pr[X_2=1|Y=0]Pr[X_1=1|Y=0]Pr[Y=0]}{\sum_y Pr[X_1=1 | Y=y]Pr[X_2=1 | Y=y]Pr[Y=y]}$ (Conditional Probability, Independence)

# Question 3

Construct a Bayesian network and determine the probability

$$Pr[WG=1, RS=1, R=0, S=0]$$

## Recap

* Any useless variables from the table?

---

## Answer

**Lemma 1.** Given two random boolean variables A and B, if $Pr[A | B] = 0$ and $Pr[A | \neg B] = 1$ then $Pr[A] = 1-Pr[B]$; in fact, $A \equiv \neg B$. 

Not difficult to proof (*Note the notation change.*):

$$
Pr[A | B] = 0 \wedge Pr[A | \neg B] = 1 \implies Pr[A] = 1-Pr[B]
$$

$Pr[A]$

* $=Pr[A \wedge B] + Pr[A \wedge \neg B]$ (Marginalisation)
* $=Pr[A | B]\times Pr[B] + Pr[A | \neg B]\times Pr[\neg B]$ (Conditional Probability)
* $=Pr[\neg B]=1-Pr[B]$ (Subt given)

So, $Pr[A \wedge \neg B \wedge \cdots] = Pr[\cdots| A \wedge \neg B] \times Pr[A \wedge \neg B] = Pr[\cdots|A]\times Pr[A]$,

* Since, $Pr[A \wedge \neg B] = Pr[A | \neg B]\times Pr[\neg B] = Pr[A]$; 
* And, $Pr[\cdots| A \wedge \neg B] = Pr[\cdots\wedge \neg B| A] / Pr[\neg B| A ] = Pr[\cdots| A]$
